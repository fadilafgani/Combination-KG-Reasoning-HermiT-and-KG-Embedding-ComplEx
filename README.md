# How to running
1. Run the speckledBand data - New (Result Reasoner with HermiT) using the HermiT reasoner in Protege.
2. Then save the reasoner results.
3. Execute the code in the Source Code folder.
4. Then save the results.
5. Continue by running the speckledBand_update_... data in the Result Reasoner with HermiT folder using the HermiT reasoner in Protege, then save and execute the code again in the Source Code folder and save the results. Repeat this step until the specified iteration is completed.
